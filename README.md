# LethalCompany-CustomTelevisionVideo

This is a fork of the CustomTelevisionVideo mod by [flipf17 / FlipMods](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/CustomTelevisionVideo/source/).

This fork adds the ability to play a random video from a configured folder path. It uses the dungeon seed from the game to ensure the videos are in sync with other players that have the same video files.
